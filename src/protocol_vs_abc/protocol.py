"""
Mypy don't complain âœ… at instantiation level when we have an incomplete concrete class.
This is because we don't need inheritance/implementation with Protocols.
Protocols are meant for clients, if a client request an API of the form of 'EmailSender',
then any object that fulfills that contract will pass the mypy check.
Its name is 'static duck typing'.
